title: About me

Hi, my name is David and I am a programmer. I studied computer science at Umass Amherst and now I write code for my job and in my free time for fun.

I always hear people say "Teaching is the best way to learn." So that is what I intend to do here. With each post I will try to explain a subject to better my own understanding of it and hopefully teach you something along the way.


Some topics you can expect to find here are programming, networking, distributed systems, and whatever else I find interesting.

A few things I am interested in outside of programming include running, backpacking, rock climbing, canoeing, and music.
